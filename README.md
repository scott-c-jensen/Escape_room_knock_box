# Escape_room_knock_box
A simple arduino based box that stays locked until knocked in a specific pattern. This project contains the code, wiring diagram and a 3d model for mounting.

Here is the wiring diagram which includes the following:
  - Arduino nano
  - one 8x AA/AAA battery holder (or two 4x wired as shown in the diagram)
  - one TIP 120 transistor
  - one 1N4001 diode
  - one Piezo electric sensor
  - one 2.2 kÎ© resistor
  - one solenoid lock (9-12V operation normally closed)
  - (optional) one protoboard
